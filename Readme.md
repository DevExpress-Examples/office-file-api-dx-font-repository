# Word Processing Document API â€“ Detect and Download Fonts

The following example detects and loads custom fonts used within a document. The application obtains a list of all fonts used in the document and loads them from the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) resource, when required. Loaded fonts are added to the [DXFontRepository](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.Drawing.DXFontRepository) automatically and made available without additional installation requirements.

## Implementation Details

The application uses the [DocumentIterator API](https://docs.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/DevExpress.XtraRichEdit.API.Native.DocumentIterator) to detect fonts used in a document loaded to the [RichEditDocumentServer](https://docs.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/DevExpress.XtraRichEdit.RichEditDocumentServer) instance. The application lists them in a table. You can click **Load From Google Fonts** button for an individual font or click **Load all Fonts from Google Fonts** to download all.

The fonts are loaded from Google Fonts and added to the [DXFontRepository](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.Drawing.DXFontRepository). When all fonts are added to the font collection, click the **Download as PDF** button to open the resulting document in PDF format.
